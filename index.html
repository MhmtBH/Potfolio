                    At the age of 15, I started coding by making games with Unity. In this process, I joined many game jams and tried many programming languages over time. For example, I learned programming languages and markup languages such as C#, Python, HTML and CSS. Thanks to this adventure, I have reached the level of website building and game development with Unity, but I am still a junior developer, I am learning new things and I am constantly working to use what I have learned more efficiently.

                I developed myself in the field of design since I have been interested in drawing since my childhood. I meticulously did my work such as logo, web designs, vector designs and 3D models.
